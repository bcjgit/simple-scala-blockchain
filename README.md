# [WIP] simple-scala-blockchain
A very simple blockchain-esk thing written in scala.
Somewhat based on / inspired by https://www.baeldung.com/java-blockchain ... but make it Scala!

## TODO (partial, circa Aug. 2021) 
1. Finish writing tests
2. Add actual "chain" logic (currently it just does mining)
3. Optimize perf
